In a tranquil village nestled between mountains, lived a wise potter named Vimal. Vimal was renowned not just for the exquisite pots he crafted but also for the serene manner in which he worked. Children would often gather around his workshop, not to watch the pots take shape, but to observe the calm demeanor of the potter.<br>

<p>One day, a curious child asked Vimal, “Why do you always seem so peaceful, even if the pot breaks or doesn’t come out as expected?” Vimal smiled and replied, “I do my work with complete focus and dedication, giving my best to every pot I craft. But once it’s done, I don’t dwell on how it turns out. Like in the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, I believe that yoga is skill in action. It’s not about the result but the dedication and skill you put into the action.”<br>
